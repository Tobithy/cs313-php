    <p>
      Hello and welcome to my homepage for CS 313. My name is Gordon Mancuso. I am a medical physicist, and am currently pursuing a software engineering degree at Brigham Young University - Idaho.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am married with two kids. Below is a picture of my awesome family.

    <h2>Firefly: The Game</h2>
    <p>
      One of my favorite things to do in my spare time (of which there is precious little these days) is to play board games. I have played many different games, and always am interested in learning new games. One of my favorite games of all time is <a href="https://firefly.gf9games.com/">Firefly: The Game</a>. The game is really a labor of love, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the TV series.
